# Build a 6502 computer
Learn how computers work by building and programming a computer with the classic 6502 microprocessor. This was the first truly low-cost microprocessor that started the personal-computing revolution. 
Versions of 6502 found their way into the Atari 2600, Apple II, Nintendo Entertainment System, Commodore 64, Atari Lynx, BBC Micro and many other computers and game consoles of the era.



Schematics
Here's the schematic for the computerâ€”or at least as far as I went with the initial series of videos. The 6502 kit above includes all the parts to build this (plus a few extra buttons and LEDs to give you some options for I/O.)

Schematic of the 6502 computer
And here's the schematic for the computer with the 6551 UART providing an RS232 serial interface. The 6551 and MAX232 chips shown here are included in the serial interface kit above.
